// This functionality is currently covered by the "Onboarding" view which can act as a settings edit page.
// In a full app, this would wrap Onboarding with different headers or navigation context.
// For this MVP, we will reuse the Onboarding component logic via a prop if needed, or just route to it.
// Placeholder to ensure file structure completeness if extended later.
